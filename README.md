### Contributing & Release Process
Anything in the `main` branch should work as expected with as little effort as possible.  The `dev` branch is where new features, defined by milestones, can be added prior to a release.  Currently, there is no schedule for releases, but once all items in a milestone are completed, they should be merged into `main`, with the exception of bug/break fixes.

If you're interested in suggesting changes, please fork the repo, check out the `dev` branch, and create a feature branch from that.  Once a PR is opened against our `dev` branch, it can be reviewed and pulled into `main`. There are no naming requirements for PR's or branches, though the project default relies on a year/week_numberPushIdentifier, `2024_47A` for example indicates the 2024 year, week 47, first push/merge (A) for that week. If a second feature is worked on that week, the branch for that would be `2024_47B`.

Input/comments/feedback for any open PR is always welcome.
